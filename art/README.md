# Art

This folder holds all of the raw files we used when creating the art for Arcane Relay. 

These will most likey not laod here on GitHub and you'll also need special tools in order to open them. Below is a list of the tools we used and their corresponding file types for reference: 

- *Affinity:* Used for concept art, thumbnails, and Arcane Relay logo design. File type: `.af`
- *Asesprite:* Used for all our textures on our mod. File type: `.ase`
- *FLStudio:* Used for the one sound effect in our mod. Note this is one file that I just exported several times with different values for the note. File Type: `.flp`
